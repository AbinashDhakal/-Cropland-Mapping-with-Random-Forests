# Cropland Mappingm with Random Forests

Cropland mapping is a critical task in agricultural monitoring and management. This repository contains code for cropland mapping using Random Forests, a popular machine learning algorithm, implemented in Python.

## Overview

Cropland mapping involves classifying remote sensing data to identify different types of crops or land cover classes. This project focuses on using Random Forests to classify satellite imagery into different crop classes.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from 'WinnipegDataset.txt', which contains various features related to cropland characteristics along with the corresponding class labels. The dataset is preprocessed to handle feature intercorrelation and is split into features and labels for model training.

## 
Approach
Data Preprocessing: Features are preprocessed to handle intercorrelation, and highly correlated features are dropped. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets.

Random Forest Model Building: A Random Forest classifier is trained on the training data and evaluated on the testing data. The classifier's performance is assessed using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the Random Forest model is evaluated using a confusion matrix, providing insights into the model's classification accuracy per crop class.
## Results
The Random Forest model demonstrates high accuracy in cropland mapping, achieving accurate predictions for various crop classes. The confusion matrix highlights the model's performance per class, indicating areas of potential improvement, such as distinguishing between wheat and oat crops.

## Future Work

Hyperparameter Optimization: Explore techniques for optimizing Random Forest hyperparameters to improve classification performance further.

Feature Engineering: Experiment with additional feature engineering techniques to enhance model discriminative power.
